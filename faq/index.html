                        <p><strong>What is LocateMate, and how does it work?</strong><br>
                        LocateMate is a wristband and app system designed to help festival-goers keep track of their friends' locations, even when mobile signal is unavailable. The wristband pairs with the LocateMate app, allowing you to view your friends’ positions on a map within the app.</p>
            
                        <p><strong>Which festivals use LocateMate?</strong><br>

                        <p><strong>Is LocateMate included with my festival ticket, or must I purchase it separately?</strong><br>
                        LocateMate is usually an included service. You will be given one at ticket collection. For add-on festivals, you can purchase it when booking your festival ticket or on-site at the festival. Please check with your festival for details.</p>
            
                        <p><strong>Are there any additional fees?</strong><br>

                        <p><strong>How do I get my wristband?</strong><br>

                        <p><strong>How do I give my wristband back at the end?</strong><br>
                        Most festivals will have drop-off stations where you can return your wristband. These are typically located near the festival exits.</p>
